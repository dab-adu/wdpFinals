					<li>Make sure you a clean vase - especially the interior, so that bacteria will not reduce the lifespan of your beautiful bouquet.</li>
					<li>Take out wilting petals and leaves immediately to avoid contamination.</li>
					<li>Remove any leaves below the water line. This will not only make your arrangement look better but also prevent bacterial growth.</li>
					<li>Cut the stems diagonally with a knife and submerge the stems in the water.</li>
